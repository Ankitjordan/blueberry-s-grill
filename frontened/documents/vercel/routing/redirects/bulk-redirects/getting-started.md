# Getting Started

Last updated March 17, 2026

Bulk redirects can be specified either as part of a Vercel deployment or updated immediately through the UI, API, or CLI by settings redirects at the Project level without the need for a new deployment.

Help me set up Bulk Redirects for this Vercel project. First, make sure the Vercel CLI is installed (`npm i -g vercel`). If I'm using Claude Code or Cursor, install the Vercel Plugin (`npx plugins add vercel/vercel-plugin`). For other agents, install Vercel Skills (`npx skills add vercel-labs/agent-skills`). Then: 1. Run `vercel link` to connect the project. 2. Use `vercel redirects` to upload redirect rules for large-scale URL migrations without redeploying.

## [Deployment-time redirects](#deployment-time-redirects)

Bulk redirects in deployments are specified in the `bulkRedirectsPath` field in `vercel.json`. `bulkRedirectsPath` can point to either a single file or a folder with up to 100 files. Vercel supports any combination of CSV, JSON, and JSONL files containing redirects, and they can be generated at build time.

Learn more about bulk redirects fields and file formats in the [project configuration documentation](/docs/project-configuration/vercel-json#bulkredirectspath).

1. ### [Create your redirect file](#create-your-redirect-file)

   You can create fixed files of redirects, or generate them at build time as long as they end up in the location specified by `bulkRedirectsPath` before the build completes.

   redirects.csv

   ```
   source,destination,permanent
   /old-blog,/blog,true
   /old-about,/about,false
   /legacy-contact,https://example.com/contact,true
   https://old-domain.com/blog,/blog,true
   ```

   redirects.json

   ```
   [
     {
       "source": "/old-blog",
       "destination": "/blog",
       "permanent": true
     },
     {
       "source": "/old-about",
       "destination": "/about",
       "permanent": false
     },
     {
       "source": "/legacy-contact",
       "destination": "https://example.com/contact",
       "permanent": true
     },
     {
       "source": "https://old-domain.com/blog",
       "destination": "/blog",
       "permanent": true
     }
   ]
   ```

   redirects.jsonl

   ```
   {"source": "/old-blog", "destination": "/blog", "permanent": true}
   {"source": "/old-about", "destination": "/about", "permanent": false}
   {"source": "/legacy-contact", "destination": "https://example.com/contact", "permanent": true}
   {"source": "https://old-domain.com/blog", "destination": "/blog", "permanent": true}
   ```
2. ### [Configure bulkRedirectsPath](#configure-bulkredirectspath)

   Add the `bulkRedirectsPath` property to your `vercel.json` file, pointing to your redirect file. You can also point to a folder containing multiple redirect files if needed.

   vercel.json

   ```
   {
     "bulkRedirectsPath": "redirects.csv"
   }
   ```
3. ### [Deploy](#deploy)

   Deploy your project to Vercel. Your bulk redirects will be processed and applied automatically.

   ```
   vercel deploy
   ```

   Any errors processing the bulk redirects will appear in the build logs for the deployment.

## [Project Redirects](#project-redirects)

Project-level redirects let you create and update bulk redirects without needing to redeploy. Redirects are staged when created and can be immediately published to production without a new deployment.

1. ### [Navigate to the Redirects tab](#navigate-to-the-redirects-tab)

   From your [dashboard](/dashboard), select your project and click the [Redirects](https://vercel.com/d?to=%2F%5Bteam%5D%2F%5Bproject%5D%2Fredirects&title=Go+to+Redirects).
2. ### [Create a redirect](#create-a-redirect)

   Click Create and enter the following:

   * Source: The path or URL to redirect from (e.g., `/old-page` or `https://old-domain.com/page`)
   * Destination: The path or URL to redirect to (e.g., `/new-page`)
   * Status code: Select `307` (temporary) or `308` (permanent)

   You can also configure whether the redirect should be case sensitive (default `false`) or whether query parameters should be preserved (default `false`).
3. ### [Test your changes](#test-your-changes)

   New redirects are staged until you publish them. From the review redirects dialog, click on the source path for each redirect to open a staging URL where the new redirects are applied.
4. ### [Publish your changes](#publish-your-changes)

   After testing your redirects, click Publish to make your changes live.

### [Editing and deleting redirects](#editing-and-deleting-redirects)

To edit or delete a redirect:

1. From the Redirects tab, find the redirect you want to modify.
2. Click the three dots menu on the right side of the redirect row.
3. Select Edit or Delete.
4. Click Publish to apply your changes.

### [Bulk upload](#bulk-upload)

You can upload multiple redirects at once:

1. From the Redirects tab, click the Create button and click CSV.
2. Select a CSV file containing your redirects.
3. Review the changes and click Publish.

### [Using the CLI](#using-the-cli)

You can manage redirects using the [Vercel CLI](/docs/cli/redirects). Make sure that you are using at least version `49.1.3` of the CLI.

terminal

```
# List all redirects
vercel redirects ls

# List all redirects versions
vercel redirects ls-versions

# Add a redirect
vercel redirects add /old-path /new-path --permanent

# Bulk upload CSV files
vercel redirects upload my-redirects.csv

# Remove a redirect
vercel redirects rm /old-path

# Promote staging redirects
vercel redirects promote 596558a5-24cd-4b94-b91a-d1f4171b7c3f
```

### [Using the API](#using-the-api)

You can also manage redirects programmatically through the [Vercel REST API](/docs/rest-api/reference/endpoints/bulk-redirects). This is useful for automating redirect management from webhook events, such as managing redirects in a CMS and instantly updating Vercel with changes.

terminal

```
curl -X PUT "https://api.vercel.com/v1/bulk-redirects" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $VERCEL_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "teamId": "team_123",
    "projectId": "project_123",
    "redirects": [
      {
        "source": "/old-path",
        "destination": "/new-path",
        "permanent": true
      }
    ]
  }'
```
